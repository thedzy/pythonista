# pythonista

Here is code created through pythonista.  I can't say that there will be much here as I have found coding on the phone somewhat inefficient.

## FAQ
### What should I expect?
A dumping ground.  Stuff I create in pythonista will not have the same level of testing, or effort as something I create on the desktop. This is just to give back into the code base.  It may be tstuff I tried and failed stuff too.

### Why bother sharing it all?
Some of the code is useful, some ideas, or sometimes a great starting point or useful to someone.  Maybe someone can fork it and turn it into gold.

### Will the code be useable?
Maybe.  This will have way less documentation than normal.  This is all just stuff I started and maybe finished on an iPhone.

### How will I know the state of the code
You wont, sorry.

### Why is there so little here?
Becauase I just do not code on the iPhone.  BUt love the idea.
